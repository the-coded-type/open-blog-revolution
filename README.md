You can see a preview [here](https://open-blog-revolution.netlify.app/).

## Philosphy

OBR is an HTML-first blog template. It adheres to the principles of [Resilient Web Design](https://resilientwebdesign.com/) and aims at delivering fast and accessible websites. It uses a **Static Site Generator (SSG)** to build static HTML (Javascript free) pages from the blog content. It uses a file-based system as a database, which makes it easy to host on GitHub or build locally.

## Who is it for?

* Writers who look for a simple solution to build self-hosted blogs.
* Developers who look for a starter template to expand on.

## Self-hosting?

Any OBR blog can be hosted anywhere. This document provides instructions to install it on the free [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) tier.

## How to start Blogging

⚠️ Now that your blog is installed you need to setup a backend that will allow you to write and publish blogs.

### If you're comfortable with using markdown and GitHub

You can edit and create posts in the GitHub repo directly.

* You can add posts as `.mdx `files in the `/src/content/posts` folder
* You can add pages as `.mdx `files in the `/src/pages` folder
* Media (images) must be located in `/src/content/media`
* Edit `/blog-config.yaml` to configure your blog.

## Images

Mdx posts accept local and remote images.

Local images must be placed in `src/media`.

In .mdx files and the posts frontmatter you don't need to specify the full path for images, just the filename, OBR figures out the image path.

Example: `![ALT](filename.ext TITLE)`

Images in .mdx files must be in their own paragraph:
This is correct 

```markdown
Some text

![ALT](filename.ext TITLE)

Some text
```

This is not correct 

```markdown
Some text
![ALT](filename.ext TITLE)
Some text
```

Partial project structure:

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│   └── content/
│       └── posts/
│   └── media/
└── blog-config.yaml
```
New posts must have the following **frontmatter**

```yaml
---
title: Post title
description: Post description
pubDate: yyyy-mm-dd
status: published | draft
author: Author name
tags:
  - tag
cover:
  src: ../../media/filename.ext - relative path 
  title: string
  alt: string
---
```
Posts **must** have at least one tag.

`.mdx` is similar to Markdown but allows you to use HTML tags.

## Blogroll
The template features a blogroll showing the latest posts from blogs you wish to follow.

The list of followed blogs is located in `src/data/blogroll.mdx`. Adapt this to contain the list of URLs of the feeds you wish to include, following the existing examples.

## Customizing the look of your blog
The recommended method of customizing your blog is via the file `src/styles/user-styles.css`. Use this to overwrite the defaults set in the other `*.css` files.

The file contains some examples already, and will be expanded at the project develops.

This file also contains descriptions of how to change other files to get your desired look. However, some general notes:
* The file `src/layouts/baselayout.astro` is the basis of everything on the blog and always gets loeaded.
* The file `src/pages/[slug].astro` is the basis for all blog posts.
* The file `src/pages/index.astro` is the front page of your blog. It imports the contents from `/src/data/home.mdx`.
* The file `src/pages/blogroll.astro` is the blogroll page of your blog.
* The file `src/pages/404.astro` is a custom 'page not found' page if someone gives an incorrect post URL.
* Various files in `src/components/` are used to set re-used page elements, such as headers and footers. Their contents are given in `.mdx` files in `/src/data/`.
